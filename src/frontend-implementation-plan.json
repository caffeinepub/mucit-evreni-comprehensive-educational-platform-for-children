        "On the Profile Settings page (frontend/src/pages/ProfileSettings.tsx), the student number section shows a clickable copy icon/button adjacent to the student number display.",

        "If the Clipboard API is unavailable or the copy operation fails, the UI shows an error feedback state/message rather than failing silently.",
        "After a successful copy, the UI provides a clear success feedback (e.g., toast or temporary label change) without navigating away from the page.",
        "The copy control is keyboard-accessible and includes an accessible label (e.g., aria-label=\"Copy student number\")."

Show success and error feedback (e.g., via existing toast system or an inline temporary label) and ensure accessibility via a real <button>, keyboard operability, and an aria-label."
