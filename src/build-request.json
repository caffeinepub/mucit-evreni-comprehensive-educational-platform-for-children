      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "On the Profile Settings page (frontend/src/pages/ProfileSettings.tsx), the student number section shows a clickable copy icon/button adjacent to the student number display.",
        "Clicking the copy control copies the unformatted studentNumber value (no spaces) to the clipboard.",
        "If the Clipboard API is unavailable or the copy operation fails, the UI shows an error feedback state/message rather than failing silently.",
        "After a successful copy, the UI provides a clear success feedback (e.g., toast or temporary label change) without navigating away from the page.",
        "The copy control is keyboard-accessible and includes an accessible label (e.g., aria-label=\"Copy student number\")."
